Hi Max,

Not really. IMO using the ELM327 chip as a 'native SocketCAN' interface 
at https://github.com/norly/elmcan is really cool.

But I wonder if the limitations of the ELM327 chip to make it act like a 
raw CAN interface can justify to put this driver into mainline kernel.

Best regards,
Oliver

But as long as you remember how you've configured your own ELM, you are free to use whichever baudrate you like. Again, I haven't tried this, please don't brick your ELM ;)

The only situation when it will ACK is for about 1-2 seconds immediately after the ELM sends a frame. Afterwards, it goes back into monitoring mode, where it will not ACK any frames (like "listen-only" in the 8devices USB2CAN).
