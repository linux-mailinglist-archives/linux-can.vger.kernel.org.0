Does the mcp251xfd use the host clock to do its hardware timestamp?
(Not sure how SPI hardware works and if they have their own quartz or
if they share it with the host system). If it is indeed the same clock
you can have even more precise statistics.

What I was thinking is that tools such as tcpdump are able to get TX
packets of ethernet interfaces even if not normally visible (because
contrary to CAN, there is no default loopback). I was wondering if the
same could be done with error queues, but as you can guess my research
did lead anywhere. I also guess there is no official support but then,
I am wondering how hard it would be to hack the error queues to expose
them to the privileged processes.

Thanks!
I also see you did a quick cleanup.
