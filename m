And I agree and understand the change just not the commit.

Its only confusing because what you are changing is for the MCAN IP code 
and is not specific to TCAN.Â  The change affects all devices that 
register to the m_can framework.

Referencing the TCAN data sheet for the Bosch IP implementation is not 
correct.

All the commit message should say is basically what the $subject says 
because that is all it is doing.
