Actually, the queue size is configured in software through
c_can_driver_data->msg_obj_num. Example:


https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13/source/drivers/net/can/c_can/c_can_platform.c#L196

And all the values for D_CAN are either 32 or 64.

Not sure 100%, but I can imagine this appearing on single core systems
as well if the scheduler decides to stop in the middle of c_can_do_tx().

It is clear that c_can_start_xmit() and c_can_do_tx() are racing between
each other. So let's go back to the lockless queue topic, and see what
could have gone wrong. As established the queue size is not the issue.

So it means that c_can_start_xmit() and c_can_do_tx() are doing
concurrent read and writes as corroborated by your observations and
analysis.

On important aspect of the lockless queue is the self discipline.
Because it is lockless, the writer should monitor the occupancy of the
queue and stop writing when it is full. Similarly, the reader should
first free the slots *before* notifying the reader that these slots
became available again.

If the writer stops the queue too late or if the reader resumes the
queue too early, bad things happen.

Back to the network queue, this logic will be controlled using the
netif_wake_queue() and netif_stop_queue():

  - just before the head reaches the queue, c_can_start_xmit() must call
    netif_stop_queue() so that the network frame work stop calling that
    function

  - once c_can_do_tx() finishes reading the queue, it calls
    netif_wake_queue() to notify the network framework that it is safe
    again to call c_can_start_xmit().

With the good git commands, reverting commits should be an easy task.
Example working on the stable tree:

  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
  cd linux
  git checkout v6.1.43
  git revert 81d192c2ce74 # revert [2]
  git revert 387da6bc7a82 # revert [1]
  editor drivers/net/can/c_can/c_can_main.c # resolve the conflict
  git add drivers/net/can/c_can/c_can_main.c # add conflict resolution
  git revert --continue # continue and commit the revert of [1]

(this is FYI, your analysis gave enough information so that this revert
is not necessary anymore).

If it becomes 0 and tail is still greater than 0 (there are still messages in the last objects that are waiting to be sent), the message must be cached (TX request must not be set), because the controller sends the messages object with the lowest index first. If it wasnât cached, it would bypass the messages in the objects with the higher index.

Yes! It is netif_stop_queue().

This bothers me the most. This check occurs *after* the call to
netif_wake_queue() so anything in this if block is not guarded anymore
and can race against c_can_start_xmit().

Putting spinlock will of course solves your issue, but it just papering
over the root cause. Here we need to find where the queue wake/stop
logic went wrong.

Great. Have a look at these:


https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2017/05/16/submitting-your-first-patch-to-the-linux-kernel-and-responding-to-feedback/
  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html

When you describe your changes in your patch, go for conciseness. No
need for the politeness, go strait to the point.

A good way to describe the race condition is through some ASCII art
diagram, something like this:

         CPU 1                   CPU 2

           |                       |
    c_can_do_tx()                  |
           |                       |
      netif_wake_queue()           |
           |                       |
           |               c_can_start_xmit()
           |                       |
      c_can_object_put()     can_put_echo_skb()

If you have a dmesg error log, it is also good to attach it at the

Have a look at:

  git log --grep="race condition"

to see how people usually describe their patch when fixing a race condition.
