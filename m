My divine friend



Greetings, I wish you and your family happy moments in life now and forever
more amen. I am Mrs. Alicia H. Abraham from the United States of America by
birth, but a German by origin. It is a pleasure for me to have contact with
you, although I do not know you, that I was hospitalized in Washington
General Hospital, USA, and my contact with you was not accidental but
through divine connection. I suffered from lung cancer for years and my
doctors bravely told me that if I didn't opt for surgery that has 50/50
chances of survival, I would have short time to live, so please I need your
prayers.

However, I don't know when death will come, but I have a strong desire to
help the poor orphans who suffer every day, but this dream cannot be
realized because of my poor health which is not improving. Therefore, I
don't know if I will survive after that.Therefore, I made up my mind to
donate to you my legacy of $ 26 million ($ 26,000,000) that belongs to my
late husband as my spirit directed me there to be used for charity because
I wanted my own people there to benefit.


It is my last wish to invest this fund in a very good business of your
choice and then use the interest generated to help the needy and the poor
and motherless babies, orphanages and widows at any time. These are the
wishes of a dying woman as I decided I would not have a child to take over
my inheritance when I grew up an orphan with no family member.


All I need from you is truthfulness, honesty and sincerity, which assure me
that you can use the means to do so with all honesty and honesty
Obedience.


Waiting for your urgent reply


Mrs. Alicia H. Abraham
