OK, I finally got your point. Your concern is that if skb->len could
be equal or less than CANFD_MTU, then there would be a collision.

My approach here would be to stop using the MTU correlation to
differentiate between CAN(-FD) and CANXL. Instead, I suggest using
can{fd,xl}_frame::flags. If can{fd,xl}_frame has a CANXL flag set,
then it is a CANXL frame regardless of the value of skb->len. If the
CANXL flag is not set, then skb->len is used to differentiate between
Classic CAN and CAN FD (so that we remain compatible with the
existing). That way, no need to impose a minimum length of
CANFD_MAX_DLEN.

I was writing while thinking that canxl_frame::data was a flexible
array member as suggested in this thread.
In that case canxl_frame::data counts as zero when doing sizeof(struct
canxl_frame). And so sizeof(struct canxl_frame) =3D=3D sizeof(struct
canfd_frame) + sizeof(af).

Actually, thinking twice, the Minimum transfer unit would be:
#define CANXL_MINLEN 1
#define CANXL_MINTU    (sizeof(struct canxl_frame) + CANXL_MINLEN)

(I forgot that the length can not be zero anymore in CANXL...)
