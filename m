I think the short introduction to CAN XL from the cover letter fits 
quite good.

Did you note this?

Because you asked about the VCID later.

There is an existing Kernel API to handle VLAN-like ID stuff. And we 
should simply use that existing mechanic as it has the same intention 
and handling for CAN XL.

The LLC frame fields in 
https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/can/can-xl/ are a mix(!) of 
Classical CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL content (e.g. ESI is only CAN FD).

The frame type flags an abstraction of
(none) -> Classical CAN
(FDF) -> CAN FD
(XLF) -> CAN XL

The CAN-ID was (due to its arbitration nature) always also a priority field.

So nothing changed here. There is no RTR and no 29-bit priority anymore 
now. The RTR flag has already been disabled for CAN FD (see presentation 
at the end of this mail).

Therefore it makes sense to handle the SFF 11-bit prio analogue to the 
former CAN-ID - and also use canid_t to simply keep the entire CAN 
filter handling in af_can.c !

The new idea in CAN XL is to split the priority from the content 
identification which has been named 'acceptance field' (AC).

The functionality of AC depends on SDT. Don't know how this will work 
out in the future and if we would provide some AF-specific filtering 
inside the kernel.

Please do not mix up (incompatible) extensions that have been 
implemented in the CAN protocol through the 'wandering' reserved bit 
(r0, now resXL) with the CAN(FD/XL) data structure.

The first suggestion for a CAN frame data structure representation in 
IEEE 1722 contained the entire bitstream definition including the IDE 
bit. That splitted the 11 and 18 bits of the CAN ID inside the data 
structure :-D

I really think, that the journey is ending with CAN XL and when there 
would be really a new improvement, we will take a look at it. E.g. by 
extending the CAN XL flags from the top down (as you suggested with 0xC0).

But who knows how much of the CAN XL frame layout would be re-used by 
CAN XY ?? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Btw. I uploaded a presentation which shows the way from classical CAN to 
CAN XL which might depict some relations of the bits in a clearer way:

https://github.com/linux-can/can-doc/blob/master/presentations/CAN-XL-Intro.pdf
