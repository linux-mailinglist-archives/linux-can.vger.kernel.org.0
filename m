ATTENTION,
        Sir/Madam.

Greetings to you, I am contacting you after going through your
interesting profile. I am Mr.William Chalmers. I am from London, United
Kingdom, If this message successfully gets to you, I will like to
discuss business with you, which you will have an immense benefit from
if we can work together with, The Group Finance Director of Lloyds
Banking Group United Kingdom.

I am contacting you for a legitimate business transaction strictly for
you and me alone. I personally discovered a dormant account with a
total sum of =C2=A3 1,35,000.000.00 - [One-hundred Thirty-Five Million GBP
Only] here in our bank. The owner of this dormant account died on 4th
Jan 2012. Since his death, nobody has operated in his account because
the account has NO BENEFICIARY attached to it. I wish to present you
as the next of kin to the bank.

Kindly get back to me as soon as possible for more details on how to
proceed further. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
Mr.William Chalmers.
