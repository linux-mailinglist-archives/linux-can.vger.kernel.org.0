Back to the idea of my initial e-mail :)

If we could go in the past, those should have appeared on the error socket.

The echo would be special here.  We have to remember that the
payload of the CAN_ERR_FLAG frames is an arbitrary design. This
payload has no meaning for the data link.

When we echo back the frame, only the DLC, CAN ID and payload of
the TX frame are irrelevant (except for vcan).

My current idea would be to follow what Kvaser did: they send the
frame and the device reports the error flag (c.f. the example
given by Jimmy above). So the echo feature would not be used
for error flags.

@Jimmy, could you confirm my understanding? Do you use the echo
functionality for error flags in the Kvaser driver?

Thanks, this is me wearing my hacker's goggles.
