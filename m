(removed the USB mailing list since this is CAN driver related
specifically)

I appreciate these pointers and I can look into making the time for this.
As I mentioned, I do have a gs_usb device (a Canable using the Candlelight
firmware) which can help shed some light on this question.  I do
understand the ideas being expressed in these pointers.  I do want to
bring up some practical matters around it.

First, it seems there's a pretty strong set of permutations to consider,
given that this memory allocation scheme is common to so many drivers.  I
only have a gs_usb device (a Canable using its CandleLight firmware).  I
also cannot rule out the possibility that the underlying hardware of the
host matters here.  For example, I discovered this leak in the first place
because I work with a specific ARM platform where it's easy to exhaust the
DMA memory.

Secondly, this sort of benchmarking work will require lab setup time and
my locating adequate free time in which to do it.  This isn't exactly
labor covered under the original mandate from my employer, so I'm going to
have to figure out how to work it in.

In light of this, while I remain committed to helping work the problem, I
can't help but wonder if it's worth it to consider my original patch in a
new light?  The code is less elegant than it otherwise could be, but it's
consistent with practices found in the other drivers and it does resolve
the original issue of leaking DMA memory.  I'd hate to see a long-standing
issue continue to languish because I struggle to find adequate time to
devote to the benchmarking needed to reach a decision about the USB API
changes we've proposed.

Best,
Rhett
