I should clarify that we already have an older internal test board with 
the chip working, using the driver by Martin Sperl. I'm evaluating the 
possibilities to migrate to this driver in the future, since I can see 
it is being mainline, but for now I mainly wish to use it on a new 
internal test board.

On the board I'm currently working on getting up and running, we have no 
need for GPIOs or any of the other advanced features of the MCP2518FD. 
On our older board, we do utilize the GPIO and oscillator output 
functionality of the chip. It works for now with the old driver, so it 
is not a priority. It would be nice to have this functionality in the 
future for us.

I can provide some test information if needed, as I have internal 
testing hardware with a 4 MHz oscillator already. Are there any specific 
message sequences that needs to be tested?

The chip will most likely not reach high loads with the setup we have in 
mind, so I'll manually change the frequency check in the probe function 
for now.

It's great to hear the reasoning. Thanks for the hard work you and 
others have put into this driver and the whole CAN system in linux.

Regards, Magnus.
