Hm. This is a really iterative process ;-)

Maybe

#define CANXL_XLF 0x80 /* mark CAN XL frame (must be set) */
#define CANXL_SEC 0x01 /* Simple Extended Content (security/segmentation) */

looks even more natural:

The MSB is set and the other bits start from LSB as usual.

I think the dual-use pattern does not make sense anymore as either the 
flags element and the len element have been moved away from the struct 
can[fd]_frame layout.

There is no layout match between CAN XL and CAN/CANFD anymore.

ACK.

IMO this 0x80 bit at this specific position is an excellent flag to 
introduce CAN XL frames and to provide a proper break with CAN/CANFD 
data structures.

I see it as a practical thing for programmers (also in userspace) to 
allocate sizeof(struct canxl_frame) and do all the checks and operations 
similar to struct can[fd]_frame (and the ISO CAN Spec).

It just makes it very clear what we are talking about.

The fact that we can reduce the content size whenever we transfer 
content from/to kernel space or inside the kernel is just a nice 
optimization IMO.

Thanks for your feedback! I think I'll post an updated patch set later 
today to continue the discussion on a new code basis.

Best regards,
Oliver
