Hey,

I did struggle with a variscite imx8+MCP25xxfd system.

I did not experience issues by using the real 20MHz upper limit here.

off-topic:
Variscite deploys a 20HHz oscillator, which brings the max spi frequency
down to +/- 8.5MHz.
After discussion with Thomas Kopp, I learned that microchip uses a 40MHz
oscillator, to arrive (close to) 20MHz spi freq.
Would you not use a 40MHz oscillator too?

I see. On 125k, the 20MHz crystal is sufficient.

There is something bizarre with the DMA implementation of imx.
The variscite device-tree's come with dma disabled in their SPI nodes,
using

	&ecspi1 {
		status = "okay";
		/delete-property/ dmas;
		/delete-property/ dma-names;
	};

Since I was struggling to consume 1Mbit, I tried to enable DMA again,
and ran into the same SPI tranfer failed. Disabling DMA fixes this.

This is a workaround.
and it works for me.

Kind regards,
