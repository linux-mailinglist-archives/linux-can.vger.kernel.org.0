This sounds really exciting. I also wanted to play with linuxptp but
never had time to start.

With the device clock synchronized, you can have decent timestamping
between different hardware (potentially of different brands).
The drawback is that you would lose a bit of precision: the hardware
timestamp have an accuracy around 1 microsecond. After using PTP, I
would expect the precision to degrade to roughly 100 microsecond
(which is still way better than what software timestamping can offer).

I never went so far.

For tcpdump, the interested flags are:
  * -J (a.k.a. --list-time-stamp-types)
  * -j tstamp_type (a.k.a. --time-stamp-type=tstamp_type)

But I never went so far to make them work. If you want to try it,
first be sure that the driver of your network interface calls
skb_tx_timestamp() in its xmit() function.

I think so. This is just a niche topic, so we need to find the code
snippet which will put some light on this. I am convinced that some
solution should exist, just do not have enough time to investigate.
Studying the source code of tcpdump is probably one of the best idea I
can think of right now.
