Thanks for pointing this out. You are right and I completely
missed that paragraph of the ISO.

So this perfectly explains the behaviour of the mcp251xfd0. It
also means that the ACK flag is set by the transmitter so there
is indeed no way to differentiate if the frame was indeed ACKed
or not by the other nodes.

Concerning the flexcan it is not following the standard. Even if
the monitor mode is optional, once it is implemented, it should
behave as stated in chapter 10.4.

However, this still does not explain why the Peak does not
generate the ACK error flag. Also, the ISO says that in
monitoring mode, the controller "does not start a
transmission". So it also seems like a violation of the standard
that Peak devices are able to transmit frames while being in
monitor mode.


Yours sincerely,
Vincent
