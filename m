I wonder whether error queues are the right mechanism or if control 
messages needed to be extended here - like for (hardware) rx timestamps.

E.g. the packet socket can access the vlan tag with a control message. 
And when there would be a such a message for tx timetamps we could 
create an identical cmesg API that could be used by CAN and PACKET sockets.

cansend and canplayer would be candidates for such a feature too.
