The out-of-tree DTS in question was developed quickly and lazily for
getting CAN working on a prototype, where the MCU's built-in CAN had
not been routed correctly (so I added an MCP251x via SPI for testing).
It was a one-off fix for a problem that no longer exists, for hardware
which no longer exists.  Probably not the best approach to fix the
problem either.

I shared the DTS to help others at the time who might be using the
same part with similar kernel versions (~4.9?) and out-of-tree mcp2515
driver.
There is an driver available in-tree, with documentation of DTS
properties at linux://Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/microchip,mcp251x.txt

I don't care about that out-of-tree MCP2515 DTS any more, the kernel
developers certainly shouldn't care about it, and neither should
anyone else.
